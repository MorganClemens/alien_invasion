# Alien Invasion 

In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears at the bottom of the screen. The player can move the ship side to side using the arrow keys and shoot missiles using the spacebar (or other key of choice). The objective is to survive progressively larger and more agressive waves of alien ships by shooting and destroying them before they reach the bottom of the screen.
